# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

# PWA / Service Worker
#
# The Chirpy PWA layer can aggressively cache HTML/CSS/JS in production.
# If that cache becomes stale, clients may keep seeing old styles (e.g. missing Bootstrap gutters)
# even after deploys. Disable PWA/SW to ensure production always fetches fresh assets.
#
# Once production is confirmed healthy, we can re-enable it with a safer caching strategy.
